# 1.1 Think About Time Reflection

There we're quite a few time management and productivity ideas that I learned about in this challenge but the ones that stood out to me were the pomodoro technique and the Fogg Method. The pomodoro technique uses a pomodoro timer (more commonly a kitchen timer) and splits workloads into 25 minutes. You stop and take breaks after the 25 minutes is up and you can determine ahead of time how many pomodoros a certain challenge will take ahead of time. During the 25 minutes the goal is to just focus on the task at hand and to eliminate outside distractions. The pomodoroa technique goes really well with the Fogg method. This method teaches the idea of making tiny changes that will eventually turn into daily habits. By trying increments of the pomodoro technique using the Fogg method, I can become disciplined at creating my own time boxes that I believe will lead to successful, self-paced learning. Time boxing IS the pomodoro technique essentially; creating blocks of time where you work alone or in a group on one challenge and focus all your attention on that task during the time block. Currently I am focused on spending 4 to 6 hours a day on challenges early in the week with the hope  that it will lighten the workload towards the end of the week so I can take more time off towards the weekend. I'm not too sure honestly if this strategy is working since it is only day 2 so I will have to get back to you as the week rolls by. If I implement this time block strategy using the pomodoro technique and fogg method I believe I can develop strong habits towards getting challenges done efficiently and on time.


# 1.2 The Command Line Reflection

Oh man this took a while for me because I am so new to this stuff but I had a break through. While I was learning how to make directories and then look them up on the OS I got so excited and was ready to learn more and more! The "shell" is another term for the command line. What we want to focus on is the linux shell and we use bash for that. At first for me the most challenging part of the material was remembering where I was in bash, such as which directory or PATH I was currently in. Opening bash never took me directly to the master directory so I had to remember to go there first to get to the 'temp' directory where we were doing most of the lessons. The only commands I was unsuccessful in using we're 'man' and 'apropos' and that seems to be because our Git Bash program does not come installed with a manual that would normally be included in the linux shell. I messed around a little with help using Powershell to get the windows version of 'man' and that worked so I understood the lesson for the most part. The most important commands for me we're most of the directory related commands such as 'ls' (so you always remember where you are), 'cd' was used constantly and mkdir. Now let's see if I have these commands memorized by now... 

-pwd = print directory

-ls = list directory 

-mv = move directory

-cd = change directory

-../ = previous directory

-touch = make an empty file

-mkdir = make directory

-less = print/page a file

-rmdir = remove directory (so long as it's empty!)

-rm = delete/remove a file

-help = the windows shell version of 'man' which = look up a page in the manual


# 1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection

Hi new person! To start off creating a new repository we need to go to GitHub! In the top right corner of you profile click the "+" next to your avatar and select "New Repository." Before creating the repository make it Public so others can see your work and add a "MIT License". After these steps go ahead and click CREATE REPOSITORY. On this next screen you will see a 'fork' option tab near the top right corner, go ahead and click this in order to make a copy of this repo onto your GitHub profile. Once you are looking at the forked copy of the repo on your profile (confirm by looking at the user name directory in front of the repo, for example: "my-username/new-repo" as apposed to "DEVBOOTCAMP/new-repo") you will copy the HTTPS url link to your clipboard. Using git, type the command 'git clone' in front of the copied url, paste the url and wait a few moments for the cloning process to complete! Now the repo is saved locally on your computer using git! Now the reason we would fork the repo instead of creating a new one is because the process is used for repository already created by other users. It's similar to idea of creating branches of code. Forking a repo allows you to access it and edit it on your profile without making major changes to the original repo.

 

Setting up GitHub and getting it to communicate with my installed git program was pretty straightforward. Setting up git and bash was little trickier early on when i was getting used tot he command line. After jumping back a few challenges and using the 'Code School' website's interactive 'Try Git' feature, it helped me really get down the basics and the important commands used most with git.
