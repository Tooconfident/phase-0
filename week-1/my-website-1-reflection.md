Paste a link to your [USERNAME].github.io repository.

Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

In your GitHub profile, select the repository tab and click NEW. Create a name, make the repository public, check the Initialize README box and give the repository an MIT License by scrolling down the Add a license tab. click CREATE REPOSITORY and go to the repository in your profile. Copy the HTTPS URL of the repository to your clipboard. Clone it in your command line, using the commang "git clone" then paste the URL.

Describe what open source means.

Open source means that the source code developers use is available to others. Instead of being able to only see the output of a program's code, open source gives others access to the source code for sharing and editing purposes.

What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

I think open source makes a lot of sense and it allows for team members to hep one another with their code and work on projects together at the same time. Open source doesn't make me nervous one bit due to the Licenses you can attach to your code. If you want to protect your project more than others there are special licenses you can attach to the code making it harder for people to use it. This keeps it from being a complete utopia but overall I think it's great that so much is out there for everyone to use and learn.

Assess the importance of using licenses.

Licenses give the specific perameters of how people can use your code. Without licenses there would be no open source, due to automatic copyrighting in the U.S.. So licenses are important in one, allowing others to use the code and help you, and two, lets others know within what restrictions they are allowed to use everything.  It also gives the original programmer of the source code credit going forward with whatever happens.

What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

Cloning and pulling from the master were concepts that became more natural this go around. I did have to go back a few challenges to remind myself how to create branches, delete them as well as cloning repositories from GitHub, but there were no serious struggles.

Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

There was plenty of information within the challenge itself. I only had to go back a few challenges to remember some commands here and there but nothing outside the of sites found in the challenge.
