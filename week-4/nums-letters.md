# What does puts do?

### puts writes on the screen what comes after it without actually evaluating the code. It prints the output with a new line.

# What is an integer? What is a float?

### An *integer* is any number without decimal points and if you include decimal points you will have a *float*.

# What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

### So since integers have no decimal point and floats do, the same goes for their corresponding styles of division. For instance if you "puts 9 / 2" in ruby, you will get "4" back instead a calculator's answer of "4.5". This is actually not necessarily the wrong answer but you can interpret the asnwer as being what would happen if you went grocery shopping for apples, you have $9 and the apples are $2 each. Since you cannot buy half an apple you would only be able to purchase 4 apples. That is a word problem example of integer division. Float division is more towards what a calculator will do. If you "puts 9.0 / 2.0" you will get back "4.5". You must make sure to add your decimal points, otherwise ruby will consider you automatically using integers!
