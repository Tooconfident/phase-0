<!-- 
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
	It was great! I really enjoyed using the code learned from basic lessons on the codeacademy and from the videos in the challenge to actually creat something. Sure the site was a model from another actual site that was already created, but i feel the challenge really strengthened my understanding going forward so I will be more ready to design my own website.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
	The videos we're great. The semantic HTML5 elements clearly illustrate the structure of a websites contents and really do make a clear construction of what the page will look like. I had to do some outside research to figure out excactly how to link an email so when you click it, it should open your default email program as well as how to make certain symbols work in HMTL such as &copy; and I feel it boosted my confidence on being able to look up more complicated tasks in the future.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
	I feel I did pretty well. For the most part I don't really know all the formatting involved with HTML so keeping to best practices was my only option! But with no formatting this really shows me what the basic form of a website will look like, and after the challenge I compared my non-formatted design to the original webpage and it's really cool to see where it can go from what I created. I'm excited to learn how to format moving forward, but keeping to best practices is great for really nailing down the fundementals of html. 

- What seems good and bad about HTML?
	The good is that html seems to very clearly structure a webpage and it doesn't take long to build a skeleton webpage. Overall to me it seemed user friendly. I personally feel I haven't worked enough with html to develope any strong opinions on what's bad about it. One think I will say is it could probably be simplified. Especially for when you do an ordered or unordered list. I feel there could be a meta tag and you could easily make it so everything inside the <ul><ul> tags could be properly ordered without having to do 15+ <li></li> tags. Besides the clutter, the language moves pretty smoothly.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
	I definitely will retain the tree anology. If I imagine the code to act like a tree, it will help me build code that is easy to read and functions properly. I also always remind myself that the first tag you open is the last tag you close, in most cases.
